# Quantum computation for the characterization of complex biomolecules

Conventional approaches tend to be inespecific, which in terms of clinical trials translates to wasted amounts of money. With this project we aim to provide with strategies for biomolecular characterization through quantic approaches. This systems usually tend to be spefific but complex and require huge amount of computation power. However, we aim to achieve an optim workflow for dividing this systems into smaller portions or taking into account just the more relevant electrons for reducing the number of qubits required to run the algorithm.
With this, we can compute the Hamiltonian and the ground state energy of the biomolecule, hence providing with accurate information of the complex's nature.
